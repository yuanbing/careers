Build a working blog site
-------------------------

Your task, should you choose to accept, is to build a simple blogging site using Python, Django, PostgreSQL, and Apache. You will need to checkin your code to Github, so we can pull down the final result and run it locally. This means the entire codebase and any configuration files should be checked in. The following conditions must be met:
